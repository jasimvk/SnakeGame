SNAKE GAME

    the game has a START button that starts the game (at the beginning or after the end of previous round)
    the game has a snake that is a chain of segments that follow each other
    the snake moves by itself in one of 4 directions: North, East, South, and WEST
    arrow keys change the direction of the snake
    there are random elements (different types at random locations) that snake should eat "food" or avoid "poison" (the number of them could be set in your source code constants); different types of elements should look different
    if the snake eats an element it grows 1 to 3 segments, if it hits an element to avoid the snake dies
    you win if there is nothing eatable left, you loose if you hit a "poison", or boundary, or reverse the direction 180 degrees
    the score is the size of the snake
    you should remember high score
    ADVANCED: upon a win, you present a new and more challenging board and the game continues after a nice and short message
    ADVANCED: you can connect to another player over the network and then you can play against each other (game rules are yours to define)
